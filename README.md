# Platformer-Project
The two components that are added are shaders and analytics. For this project though, the only analytics I have are for a "Start game" which should
say how many players have joined in a given day. While the only shader is on the "ground" prefab, it involved some experimentation with Unity's universal pipeline shader graph asset.
Also, documentation is in Assets/documentation and credits are in Assets/credits in a .txt file

Update from the future: This game is to test out collision and velocity. The orange boxes increase jump at the cost of velocity, while blue ones are the oppisite. 
There is a playable build in Builds
