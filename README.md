# Platformer-Project
The two components that are added are shaders and analytics. For this project though, the only analytics I have are for a "Start game" which should
say how many players have joined in a given day. While the only shader is on the "ground" prefab, it involved some experimentation with Unity's universal pipeline shader graph
asset. I like it, and if you want to play with it, go on ahead. 
Also, documentation is in Assets/documentation and credits are in Assets/credits in a .txt file
Have a happy winter break
